# 2D Procedural Dungeon Generator

Small demo for practice purposes, it is based on the first Binding Of Isaac game (flash version)
* It only has rectangular shaped rooms.
* The procedural algorithm is the simplest drunkard's walk possible.

## Controls
I've added a simple RTS like camera controller if you try the demo.

Also implemented a main menu from the Escape key to input the number of rooms the dungeon will have.

Movement:
* WASD or screen edges with mouse for moving the camera.
* Shift to accelerate the movement.
* Spacebar to generate new dungeons.
